# Operational Performance & SLA Monitoring Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates an **industry-grade operational analytics pipeline** built on real commercial web server logs.  
The objective is to monitor **latency, reliability, and SLA adherence**, and to move beyond surface-level KPIs into **diagnostics and prioritization**.

The dashboard is designed to answer:
- Are we meeting SLAs?
- Where is operational risk concentrated?
- Which services should engineering teams prioritize?

## 🧱 Tech Stack
- **SQL Server (SSMS)** – Data ingestion, validation, and analytical views  
- **Power BI** – DAX measures, diagnostics, and visualization  
- **Python** – Log parsing and preprocessing  
- **GitHub** – Version control and portfolio hosting  

---

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** Public commercial web server logs (Mendeley, 2009)
- **Nature:** Real production-like traffic (non-synthetic)
- **Volume:** ~670K requests
- **Why it matters:** Real data introduces noise, skew, and long-tail latency behavior that materially impacts SLA analysis.

---

## 🛠 Data Engineering (SQL)
- Raw data ingested without transformation (all columns as VARCHAR)
- No logic applied to the raw table (best practice)
- All business and validation logic implemented in a **single analytical SQL view**:
  - Timestamp parsing
  - Latency validation
  - Error detection
  - SLA breach derivation
- Final analytical object:
vw_ops_logs_final
This view is the **only source** consumed by Power BI.

## 📊 Dashboard Features

### Executive KPIs
- Total Requests
- Average Latency
- P95 Latency
- Error Rate %
- SLA Breach %

### Diagnostics & Insights
- SLA breach trends over time
- Category-level SLA breach impact (treemap)
- Service-level prioritization using composite DAX ranking
- Conditional formatting to surface risk instantly

## 🧮 Analytics Logic (DAX)
- Percentile-based latency analysis (P95 vs average)
- Error and SLA breach rate calculations
- **Composite Ops Priority Score** combining:
- Error rate
- SLA breach percentage
- Latency impact
- Ranking logic to guide engineering focus toward highest-impact services

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- Clear separation of **data engineering (SQL)** and **analytics (DAX)**
- Emphasis on **diagnostics over vanity KPIs**
- Designed for **operational decision-making**, not just reporting
- Built entirely on **real-world data**, not synthetic examples

## 📌 Use Case
This project is well-suited for demonstrating:
- Operational analytics
- SLA monitoring and diagnostics
- Service prioritization logic
- BI best practices in interviews and portfolio reviews
